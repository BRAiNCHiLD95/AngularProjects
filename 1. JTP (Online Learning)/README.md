# JTP - An Online Learning Platform (Knowledge is Power)

This is a Project built while learning FrontEnd Development in Angular.

Goto the <i>app</i> folder to see angular specific instructions incase you want to clone the repository.

## About the Project:

An Online Learning Platform with articles to help users learn programming languages and various emerging Technologies.

### What I've Learnt:
<em><strong>BackEnd:</strong></em>
- Using PDO and Object Oriented PHP (API work).
- Creating and Working with RESTful APIs in PHP.
- Creating and Using Docker containers for hosting the (BackEnd LAMP server). Docker > XAMPP.
- Using Bootstrap 4.1 and jQuery 3.3.1 along with HTML5 and CSS3 for creating the BackEnd UI.
- Streamlining and managing AJAX calls for various operations on data.
- Reducing lines of code and extra script files by using a 'module'-like approach to PHP. (Refer files with 'Ops' in the name).

<em><strong>FrontEnd:</strong></em>
- Using Angular CLI to create an Angular App.
- Using Services in Angular to interact with PHP scripts and fetch data [from server running in docker container(s)].
- Using pipes to filter and re-structure data.
- Using Directives to run embedded content (Doesn't work on same origin - XSS and CSP errors).
- Using Angular to dynamically set METADATA for each and every page (using services and API calls)
